@PathVariable - It is used to extract data from url itself

http://www.api.com/subject/1

Now there is a situation where we need to extract 1 from the api

So : value="/subject/{id}"

@PathVariable int id

From this we can extract id from url itself


For Multiple PathVariable:

@RequestMapping(value = "/{app}/conf/{fnm}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public ResponseEntity<?> getConf(@PathVariable String app, @PathVariable String fnm)
