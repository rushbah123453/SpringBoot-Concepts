Suppose we have a situation :

We have autowired a bean
@Autowired
SortingAlgorithm myalgo;

we have 2 classes that implements SortingAlgorithm interface
1)QuickSort
2)SelectionSort

Now there are 2 classes that implements SortingAlgorithm , so spring will be confused
of which type the beans should be created

No UniqueBean Exception will be thrown

- To avoid this use
1)@Primary on one of the class
2)use @Qualifier("myalgo") on one of class
3)change myalgo variable name to one of the class name i.e QuickSort or SelectionSort
