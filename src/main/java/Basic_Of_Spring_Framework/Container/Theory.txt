Responsibility of IOC-Container

1)Find the Beans
how it find beans ? Every class annotated with @ComponentScan is considered as bean

2)Wiring Dependencies
When we use @Autowired , this will wireup the dependencies

3)Managing Lifecycle of Beans

2 terms related to IOC Container

1) Bean Factory
2) ApplicationContext == BeanFactory ++ (Updated version of BeanFactory)
Application context have webApplicationcintext and webApplication


@Component- Spring Should manage the bean
@Autowired- spring should find matching bean and wire dependency in

@ComponentScan scans all the class files specified under the base package i.e. search for the files under this package
for any annoted java files with @Component,
@Repository, @Service and @Controller and if it finds any of them it will register it into the bean factory.
