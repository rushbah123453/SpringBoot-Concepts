@Component- very Generic, used by IOC to identify class for which beans are need to be created

@Repository - Added to DAO Layer , whenever we get exceptions in jdbc , it is used to convert it into spring exception
@Repository is used for  automatic exception translation in your persistence layer.
@Repository  is stereotype for persistence layer
@Repository’s job is to catch platform specific exceptions and re-throw them as one of Spring’s unified unchecked exception.
For this, we’re provided with PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor



@Controller is stereotype for presentation layer
The dispatcher scans the classes annotated with @Controller and detects methods annotated with @RequestMapping annotations within them.
We can use @RequestMapping on/in only those methods whose classes are annotated with @Controller and it will
NOT work with @Component, @Service, @Repository etc...


@Service is stereotype for Service layer


@Lazy- Beans annotated with @Lazy will be initialized/created only when it will be called not during Application startup
