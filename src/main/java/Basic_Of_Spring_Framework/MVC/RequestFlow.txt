When user hits a url , what exactly happens ? Suppose user hits http://www.rushabh.com/data

1) User Hits this url from Broswer

2) Dispatcher servelets get the url, and using Handler maping it will map to the relevant controller method

3)It will also check the type , GET POST,PUT DELETE

4) After matching it handles the control to method and the calls the services and then DAO layer

5) And then response is sent

Summary :

Dispatcher servelet acts like front controller , then it delegates the request to appropiate controller
and then to appropriate serviceto return response
