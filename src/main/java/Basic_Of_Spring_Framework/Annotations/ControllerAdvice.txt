If we have to handle common exception which is accross multiple controllers , what can we use ?

@ControllerAdvice - Give this annotation at class level
And make methods for handling the exceptions with annotation of @ExceptionHandler(value=Exception.class)

(value=Exception.class) any exception of Exception.class or subtype will be handled here
