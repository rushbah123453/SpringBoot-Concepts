Model 1 Architecture

1) Browser -> JSP1 or JSP2 -> Model
It becomes very complex to maintain and update as everything is written in JSP
JSP here will contain the services , controller , and view


Model 2 Architecture
1) Broswer-> Servelets 1 and Servelets 2 -> model  -> View , the view shows the data extracted from view
A request comes through browser , servelts get its and extracts the relevant data and shows it in view
This is decoupled as compared to model 2 architecture


FrontController Architecture
1) Browser->FrontController->Servelts ->Model->view
Here we have an umbrella , where all request type comes and then maps to servelets
Front controller can be used to apply universal security , filters etc
